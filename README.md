### Description

The level of on-time performance is crucial to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of transport systems, and flight delays have been an all-time concern for airline operation management. The motivation of this project is to implement advanced techniques to analyze schedule adherence among major airline carriers in the United States. We aim to define and prioritize the main drivers of flight delays through data visualizations and utilize a generalized linear model to further confirm the result. The data introduced in this project is credible content provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) in 2022 retrieved on Oct.25, 2022, with 594,957 observations and 30 selected variables.
